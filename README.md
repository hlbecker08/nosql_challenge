# nosql_challenge

I worked with Conner Dekok and Adolophus Momoh Jr. on this challenge.

Open a terminal window on the Resources folder and import the establishments.JSON using mongoimport --db uk_food --collection establishments --file establishments.json --jsonArray

NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb updates and cleans the establishments.JSON preparing it for analysis.

NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb does an analysis on the establishments and creates pandas dataframes of the results.
